* Intro

* What is Python?
..* A Python program (or any program) is a list of instructions for you computer
..* Python is an intermediate language that makes these instructions somewhat more readable for humans
..* Like any language, Python has syntax and grammatical rules that you need to follow to facilitate understanding between yourself and the computer
..* Breaking these rules causes syntax errors that break your program

* [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com)
1. run a line of code directly in the IPython console (we are using 2.7)
2. make a file and click save and run
3. make a file and  and open the Bash console and type: python the_name_of_your_file.py

(You can only have 2 consoles open at a time so you may have to close a console to see the console options)



* The python prompt
..* “Hello World!”
* Your first file!
..* “Hello World!”
* The Bash prompt

##Homework-
[Homework inspired by Nicko](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2010/12/02/sunlights-political-action-committee-pac-name-generator/)

print a super PAC name using string indices. Here is your list:

```
pac_list = [ "Action", "Against",  "Americans", "Awesome", "Citizens", "Committee", "Communist", "Country", "For", "Freedom", "Liberty", "PAC", "Patriots", "People", "Progressive", "Restore", "Results", "Sunlight", "Super", "Taxpayers", "United", "Values", "Votes", "Zealots", "Zombies"]
```

Extra credit: find the random integer function to create a new name each time you run the program. (Hint: google “python random integer”)
